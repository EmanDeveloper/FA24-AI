The History of Harappa

Harappa is an ancient city of the Indus Valley Civilization, one of the earliest urban civilizations in the world. Located in what is now Punjab, Pakistan, Harappa dates back to around 3300 BCE. It was one of the major urban centers of the Indus Valley Civilization, alongside Mohenjo-Daro.

The city was characterized by its well-planned layout, including a grid pattern of streets, advanced drainage systems, and large public buildings. The inhabitants of Harappa engaged in extensive trade with neighboring regions, evidenced by the discovery of seals and artifacts bearing inscriptions in the Indus script.

The decline of the Indus Valley Civilization, including Harappa, is believed to have occurred around 1900 BCE, possibly due to a combination of factors such as climate change, resource depletion, and invasions. Despite its decline, the legacy of Harappa continues to be of great interest to historians and archaeologists.

The archaeological site of Harappa provides valuable insights into early urban planning, social organization, and the economy of one of the world's earliest civilizations. Ongoing research and excavations continue to reveal more about this fascinating ancient city.
